I stumbled into IT through the back door starting in helpdesk support and have gone on to do a wide range of roles: project delivery, networking, and now software development.

What started as a simple need at work, I picked up learning Python a few years ago to help automate some processes. Developing software has now turned into a major passion as I enjoy deliverying solutions that are simple but effective and user-friendly.

As a curious person, I love learning new things, and my most significant learning comes from relationships and seeing things from different perspectives.
