I’ve found myself getting pulled into this narrative about AI (in my mind at least) with all of the different things I see and hear; and it has me perplexed.

Shouldn’t I be thrilled to have a pet robot write code for me?

My current mental image is of someone from the 1800s witnessing something that would have been radical for that time. Take for example, a painter seeing a photograph for the first time. I wonder if they went and broke all of their paint brushes immediately? If they did, maybe that was a sign of where their heart was. Maybe they went out and bought a camera the next day.

For me, code is more art than trade. If AI takes my job from me, I’m feeling pretty confident that I will not stop writing code.
